TO DO:

1

    Dual-layer regime cells -- almost done

    Interval propagation (client + account)

    Header auto-updates with intervals

2

    Interval selector UI (page-wide)

    Persist interval per client/account

    CAPM period auto-sync (1Y to 252, etc)

3

    Lot-aware cost basis (parallel to holdings)

    Weighted average cost display

    Exposure-at-risk metrics

4

    Regime-conditioned exposure

    Regime-specific drawdowns

    Stress testing via regime shocks
